# Bill-Li-Script
Script used to pull data directly from NWIS and have it display certain parameters such as Voltage, etc. It is still in the works as I add more stuff to it, but it does what is currently needed.

*UPDATE*
Bill Li's script will now require to pull data from different sites pertaining to Ground Water and Surface Water sites. Updated script to show parameters needed and have it display what is being requested.

The beginning lines of code were grabbed from https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval. They are fundamental for this script.
