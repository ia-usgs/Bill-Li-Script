# Bill-Li-Script
Script used to pull data directly from NWIS and have it display certain parameters such as Voltage, etc. It is still in the works as I add more stuff to it, but it does what is currently needed.

The beginning lines of code were grabbed from https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval. They are fundamental for this script.
